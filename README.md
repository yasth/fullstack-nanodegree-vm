=============

This should install using vagrant as per usual and setup some initial data.

Please note that to use the twitter login feature you **will have to** put your own twitter API keys in (if you don't you'll receive a friendly message reminding you)

It can be launched by running /catalog/catalog.py

As a special feature it has URLs for each item, and an ATOM feed for syndication.
